Movie VRB Management Web Application

This web application allows users to manage the list of movies they have watched, plan to watch, or added to their favorites list. The application allows adding new movies, editing their details, deleting them, and searching for movies by title. There is also the option to mark movies as favorites. The application is implemented using React, Redux Toolkit on the frontend, Node.js, and Express on the backend, and MongoDB for data storage. The project is fully implemented using TypeScript to ensure type safety and enhance the development experience.
